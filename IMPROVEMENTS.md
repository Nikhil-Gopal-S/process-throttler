# Process Throttler - Post-Phase 4 Improvements

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Webhook Persistence (FIXED)
**Problem**: Webhook configurations were only stored in memory and lost between command executions.

**Solution**: 
- Added `saveWebhooks()` and `loadWebhooks()` methods to persist webhook configurations to disk
- Webhooks are now saved to `/etc/process-throttler/webhooks.yaml` (or user config directory)
- Configuration is loaded on startup and saved after any modifications
- Atomic file operations ensure data integrity

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/webhook/webhook.go`: Added persistence layer with YAML serialization

### 2. Emergency Stop Safety (IMPROVED)
**Problem**: Emergency stop could potentially delete system-critical cgroups not owned by the tool.

**Solution**:
- Expanded list of protected system cgroups (Docker, Kubernetes, systemd, containerd, etc.)
- Added prefix-based ownership detection (only delete cgroups with our prefixes)
- Implemented safety checks before cgroup deletion

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/emergency/emergency.go`: Enhanced `isSystemCgroup()` function

## New Features

### 1. Daemon Management System
**Purpose**: Provide clear daemon lifecycle management and feature detection.

**Implementation**:
- Created comprehensive daemon manager with start/stop/status/restart commands
- PID file management for tracking daemon process
- Feature detection to show which features require the daemon
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

**New Files**:
- `internal/daemon/daemon.go`: Complete daemon management implementation
- `cmd/process-throttler/daemon.go`: CLI commands for daemon control

### 2. Health Check System
**Purpose**: Verify tool configuration and system compatibility.

**Features**:
- System checks: OS, permissions, cgroups, kernel version
- Configuration checks: Config files, profiles, webhooks
- Resource checks: Memory, CPU, disk space
- Daemon status verification
- JSON output support for automation

**New Files**:
- `cmd/process-throttler/health.go`: Comprehensive health check implementation

### 3. Container Environment Detection
**Purpose**: Handle path differences between host and container environments.

**Implementation**:
- Automatic detection of Docker/containerd/Kubernetes environments
- Path translation layer for configuration files
- Environment variable support (`PT_HOST_CONFIG_PATH`)

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/webhook/webhook.go`: Added `isRunningInContainer()` and `getWebhookConfigPath()`

## UX Improvements

### 1. Clear Error Messages for Daemon Requirements
When a feature requires the daemon but it's not running, users now see:
```
Error: This feature (critical-process-monitoring) requires the process-throttler daemon to be running.
Start it with: process-throttler daemon start
Or enable it as a service: systemctl enable --now process-throttler
```

### 2. Enhanced Status Commands
- `daemon status`: Shows daemon state, uptime, enabled features, and requirements
- `health --check-all`: Comprehensive system health report with recommendations

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Added explanation of CPU limit "work-conserving" behavior
- Documented daemon requirements for various features
- Added troubleshooting guidance for common issues

## Testing & Verification

### Commands to Test Improvements

1. **Webhook Persistence**:
```bash
# Add webhook
./build/process-throttler webhook add test https://example.com/hook --events critical_process_down

# Verify it persists (in new shell/process)
./build/process-throttler webhook list
```

2. **Daemon Management**:
```bash
# Check status
./build/process-throttler daemon status

# Start daemon
./build/process-throttler daemon start

# Verify features
./build/process-throttler daemon status
```

3. **Health Checks**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
./build/process-throttler health --check-all

# Get JSON output for automation
./build/process-throttler health --check-all --json
```

4. **Emergency Stop Safety**:
```bash
# Test emergency stop (won't delete system cgroups)
./build/process-throttler emergency stop "test"
```

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Daemon management isolated in its own package
- Health checks as a standalone module
- Clear feature dependency tracking

### 2. Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing directories
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### 3. Configurability
- Support for both system and user configuration directories
- Environment variable overrides for containerized deployments
- Automatic path resolution based on permissions

## Future Recommendations

1. **Persistent State Management**:
   - Consider using a lightweight embedded database (BoltDB/BadgerDB) for state
   - Implement transaction log for all operations
   - Add state migration tools for upgrades

2. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - Add OpenTelemetry support for distributed tracing
   - Implement structured logging with log levels
   - Create Grafana dashboard templates

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Add integration tests for daemon lifecycle
   - Create chaos testing scenarios
   - Implement performance benchmarks

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add configuration encryption at rest
   - Implement RBAC for multi-user scenarios
   - Add audit log shipping to external systems

## Summary

These improvements significantly enhance the production-readiness of the process-throttler tool by:
- Fixing critical persistence bugs
- Improving safety mechanisms
- Providing clear user guidance
- Adding comprehensive health monitoring
- Supporting containerized deployments

The tool is now more robust, user-friendly, and suitable for production environments.
